## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

Welcome to the course 'R in 20 days', the course will take you through all the basics you need to know about R programming. 

The course covers topics like basic data structures, importing and exporting data, accessing packages, writing customized functions, visualizing your data and also some popular statistical methods and their applications in R. After the course, you will be able to comfortably program in R and freely conduct you own analysis.

## ðŸ’¡ In this folder

Datasets used in the exercises can be found in `Data`. Some of the datasets are grabbed from the online repository of the book 'Introduction to Statistical Learning', we highly recommend this book for a better understanding to statistics.

R functions and example answers to some of the exercises used in the lecture can be found in `R`.
